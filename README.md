This is the repository of Dragon Roleplay. Here, all the neccesairy code and resources are hosted to make all the magic happen. ðŸª„

As for what Dragon Roleplay itself is, it is is a role-playing forum with a unique blend of fantasy and science fiction. Players start by creating their own characters, after which they can join a thread in which they will use them to play out stories that happen in the Dragon Roleplay universe. Your characters can influence other player's ones and, ultimately, also the world's fate, so be careful!
