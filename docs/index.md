## What is this?
Dragon RP is a role-playing forum with a unique blend of fantasy and science fiction. Players start by creating their own characters, after which they can join a thread in which they will use them to play out stories that happen in the Dragon RP universe. Your characters can influence other player's ones and, ultimately, also the world's fate, so be careful!

This wiki contains most information about the our world that might be needed in your role-play. Please note that there may be exceptions to things stated on the wiki, especially in regards to species.
