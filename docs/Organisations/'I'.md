# 'I'

!!! warning
    This page is a work-in-progress.

'I' is an mysterious and anonymous organisation based around keeping order in the overworld. 'I' is there to make sure no non-overworld creature gets to roam the overworld as human society is not yet ready to accept these "mythical creatures" into their society.

The original purpose of 'I' was to integrate the society of the underworld with that of the overworld. However, these attempts were unsuccessful.

## Departments
The organisation has 4 main departments.

### Communication
Communication makes sure I has a constant flow of money and that the organisation stays a secret.

### Technology
Technology is the department that makes new  technology for 'I' and experiments with how to use magical items to our advantage.

### Hunters-gathers
Hunter-gatherers are the part of the organisation that solely focusses on hunting down trespassers of the overworld(TOTO's) and capturing/killing them so the general public wont know about them and to protect humans from non-human threats
