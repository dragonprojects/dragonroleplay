# Characters

Characters are essential to your adventure. These are what you use to interact with the world of Dragon Roleplay. You can play and become anybody!

## Applications
In order to use your character in a thread, you must submit a character information sheet. We recommend you to include the following information:

* Name
* Gender
* Species
* Appearance
* Personality
* Skills and abilities
* Backstory

Of course, you may include whatever else you want, like images or extra tidbits about your character.

Your character sheet must be contained in a markdown file. Once you have created your character information sheet, you must upload this file and submit it for approval to an administrator. We will let you know as soon as possible whether your character is approved or whether something is still missing. Once your character is approved, you can immediately start using it in role-play!

!!! help
    If you don't know how to create a markdown file, consider using an online editor like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) and export it as a markdown file from there.

### Balancing
Technically, any character can be made as powerful as you want them to be. However, all characters with magical abilities are subjected to our [magic system](/wiki/innerworkings/magic/). They must also abide the strentgh/weakness rule. This means that all characters' strengths must be balanced a weakness or consequence if their powers are too extravagant.

!!! example
    If your character is able to kill someone very powerful, there must be consequences for him or her to do that action, something that would make it impossible or undesirable so that it would be a last resort only. If your character is incredibly powerful with fire magic, it makes sense to counter this strength with a weakness to to the cold.

In short, if you make powerful characters, make sure you balance them accordingly.

### Inventory
Your inventory needn't be clearly defined. Based on your skill and ability set and depending on the situation, you will have the items with you that would be sensible for you to have.

!!! example
    As a knight, you may have a sword with you, whereas a mage may have scrolls with them. When climbing a mountain, it makes sense for you to have things like pitons and rope.

If you come across an item that gives you a major new ability, you need to update your character sheet to reflect this. Such items can usually only be aquired in special cases, like as a reward for an extensive quest.
