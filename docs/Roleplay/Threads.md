# Threads
Threads are a collection of chronologically ordered posts. This is what is used to role-play and where stories take place in.

## Starting a thread  
When starting a thread, give it an appropriate yet creative title. Mention the players who will join the thread, as well as the characters that will partake in the story. Mention the setting and your general surroundings as to give an idea where the characters will be situated.

!!! warning
    Before you may start a thread, you must apply to become a role-player. Once your submission has been approved, you may want to create a character first.

It's strongly advised to role-play in a third person point of view.

### Freeform
The setting where your role-play takes place in can be decided upon freely. Where the story is headed towards is completely up to how the characters react to eachother. This type of role-play sees no need for a narrator and NPCs are controlled by the players. You can determine with your group who controls which NPC. It usually boils down to the following options:

* One player controls all NPCs
* Each player controls certain NPCs
* Every player can control any NPCs

It is also possible to have someone play as NPCs exclusively. This means that they will not let any of their own characters partake in the story.

### Quests
Quests are threads with a story that's guided by a narrator, which is also usually the person who has created the quest. Quests often have a pre-determined setting and an end goal and may yield special rewards. Players cannot take control of NPCs.

#### Narrators
As a narrator, you will be able to control all NPCs, as well as make any unforeseen event happen to the players. You can push the story into a specific direction if you like, though you cannot force it, as you cannot overrule any player character's actions. You tell the story from either an omniscient or NPCs point of view. No matter the situation, a narrator will not be able to control (unless convinced by an NPC) or know (unless expressed by themselves) the feelings of the player characters.

### Events
Events are similar to quests, except that they happen on a larger scale and have a large impact on Dragon RP's plot. The narrator, usually a staff member, normally plays a very small role, mostly serving to setup the setting.
