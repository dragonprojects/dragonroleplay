# Writing
Please stick to the following rules when role-playing.

* Third person POV

Stick to a third person point of view in your writing. This makes it clearer to other readers which character says or does something. It also makes it much easier to play as multiple characters at a time.

!!! example
    He washed the dishes because they didn't want to. She looked out the window and saw the starry sky while he was doing the dishes.

* No powerplay

Powerplay refers to a player shifting a story into their character's (or characters') favour. This can happen in several ways, like not keeping in-world limitations, physics and logic in mind. It may also occur that one player takes control of another player's character. In the example below, a boy who only knows fire spells is for no apparent reason able to use lightning attacks. In the same sentence, it is dictated that the lightning attack lands on the female character (in this instance played by someone else) without giving her the opportunity to counter a dodge.

!!! example
    The boy who only knew fire spells was suddenly able to hit her with a lightning attack.

Powerplay is forbidden under all circumstances and must be followed by all players, including narrators. If powerplay occurs, it's usually accidental! If you notice powerplay, politely inform the player of it.

## General writing advice

* Add some foreshadowing

It can be hard to use foreshadowing in role-play as you can't completely predict the actions of the other players. Instead, use it to foreshadow something your character will do and watch others react accordingly!

!!! example
    As he listened to her discussing her day, his heart began to sink in his chest. He felt sadness and untameable hatred building up.

* Use all your senses!

Your character can do much more than just talk. Try to incorporate all of your senses in your role-play.

!!! example
    She walked through the vibrant field, smelling freshly cut grass and feeling the nips of the blades poking through her socks. The wind rolled through, creating an oceanic sound and a crisp flavour locked at her tongue.

* Describe your characters emotions

It is important to describe not just how your character reacts physically or verbally, but also emotionally. This way, other players can more appropriately react to your actions.

!!! example
    As she looked at the statue, her smile disappeared and a tear began rolling down her cheeks. She grabbed it and smashed it, closing her eyes as she felt the emotional pain it was causing her.
